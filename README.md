# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
This project analyzes Amazon Vine program and determines if there is a bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.
We focused on the US reviews for video games and used Pyspark to perform the ETL process by extracting the data, transforming the data and connecting to the database that was generated for me through the AWS webserver. With the reviews, my goal is to analyze and determine if there is favorable review bias from the Vine members of our data set.

### Results: The total number of reviews for US video games are 1785997.
